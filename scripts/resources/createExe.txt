How to (re)create a Windows executable from dataCompetedScript.py
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install py2exe (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) for python 32 and/or 64 bit.

2. The dist subfolder already contains builds for the 32 and 64 bit Windows platforms. If you need to recreate them, follow steps 3 and 4 below.

3. Build the executable by running the following command in the console from the root of repository (one folder level higher):
    
    python resources/setup.py py2exe

    Make sure to use the correct python interpreter (if you are building executables for 32 or 64 bit).

4. The executable and the relative libraries will be in the dist/ subfolder; move them to their final location as follows.

    32bit: move everything into dist/32bit/data_completed and copy resources/data_completed_script.bat to dist/32bit
    64bit: move everything into dist/64bit/data_completed and copy resources/data_completed_script.bat to dist/64bit
